        <ol>
            <li>Red tiles are impassible, you cannot walk on them.</li>
            <li>Yellow tiles are electric, they will electrocute you.</li>
            <li>Orange tiles are orange scented, they will make you smell delicious.</li>
            <li>Blue tiles are water, swim through them if you like, but the piranhas hate the smell of oranges.</li>
            <li>If a blue tile is next to a yellow tile, the water will also zap you.</li>
            <li>Purple tiles are slathered in slippery lemon-scented soap, a scent which the piranhas do not like.</li>
            <li>Green tiles are chaos tiles, they will regenerate the puzzle.</li>
            <li>Pink tiles don't do anything. Step on them all you like.</li>
